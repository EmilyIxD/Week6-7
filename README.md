# Week6-7
Homework for weeks 6 and 7 (midterm project)
Tried to add sound to each ellipse, but could only figure out how to do the first one. After that, if I added another mousePressed function, it wouldn't play the one that came before it, so I left the first one but took out the others. The idea is that each numbered ellipse has a sound attached to it, and the object is to put the sounds in chronological order...
